# BullMQ Concepts Demonstrated

This document explains all the BullMQ concepts demonstrated in the mock application.

## üéØ Overview

BullMQ is a Redis-based job queue for Node.js that provides robust, reliable, and scalable job processing capabilities. This application demonstrates all major concepts and features of BullMQ through practical examples.

## üìö Core Concepts

### 1. Queue Management

**What it is:** Queues are the foundation of BullMQ. They store and manage jobs that need to be processed.

**Demonstrated in:**
- `src/queues/setup.js` - Multiple queue types with different configurations
- `src/routes/queue-routes.js` - Queue management API endpoints

**Key Features:**
- Multiple queue types (email, image processing, priority, etc.)
- Queue pause/resume functionality
- Queue cleaning and maintenance
- Queue status monitoring

**Example:**
```javascript
const emailQueue = new Queue('email-queue', {
  connection: redisConfig,
  defaultJobOptions: {
    removeOnComplete: 100,
    removeOnFail: 50,
    attempts: 3,
  },
});
```

### 2. Job Processing

**What it is:** Jobs are individual tasks that get processed by workers. Each job contains data and processing instructions.

**Demonstrated in:**
- `src/workers/setup.js` - Various job processors
- `src/routes/job-routes.js` - Job management API

**Key Features:**
- Job data and options
- Job lifecycle (waiting ‚Üí active ‚Üí completed/failed)
- Job progress tracking
- Job logging and debugging

**Example:**
```javascript
const job = await queue.add('send-email', {
  recipient: 'user@example.com',
  subject: 'Welcome',
  body: 'Welcome to our platform!',
}, {
  priority: 1,
  attempts: 3,
  delay: 5000,
});
```

### 3. Priority Queues

**What it is:** Jobs can have different priority levels. Higher priority jobs are processed before lower priority ones.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Priority queue in `src/queues/setup.js`
- Priority worker in `src/workers/setup.js`
- Priority job examples in `src/test-scenarios.js`

**Key Features:**
- Numeric priority levels (lower numbers = higher priority)
- Priority-based job ordering
- Dynamic priority assignment

**Example:**
```javascript
// High priority job (processed first)
await queue.add('urgent-task', data, { priority: 1 });

// Low priority job (processed last)
await queue.add('background-task', data, { priority: 10 });
```

### 4. Delayed Jobs

**What it is:** Jobs can be scheduled to execute at a future time or after a specific delay.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Delayed queue with QueueScheduler
- Delayed job examples and promotion

**Key Features:**
- Time-based job scheduling
- Job promotion (execute immediately)
- QueueScheduler for delayed job management

**Example:**
```javascript
// Job that executes in 5 seconds
await queue.add('delayed-task', data, { delay: 5000 });

// Job scheduled for specific time
await queue.add('scheduled-task', data, { 
  delay: Date.now() + 60000 // 1 minute from now
});
```

### 5. Recurring Jobs

**What it is:** Jobs that automatically repeat based on cron patterns or time intervals.

**Demonstrated in:**
- `src/scheduler/setup.js` - Recurring job setup
- Various cron patterns for different frequencies

**Key Features:**
- Cron pattern support
- Custom recurring job creation
- Recurring job management

**Example:**
```javascript
// Job that runs every hour
await queue.add('hourly-task', data, {
  repeat: { pattern: '0 * * * *' }
});

// Job that runs every day at 2 AM
await queue.add('daily-cleanup', data, {
  repeat: { pattern: '0 2 * * *' }
});
```

### 6. Job Dependencies

**What it is:** Jobs can depend on other jobs. A job won't start until its dependencies are completed.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Dependency queue and worker
- Chained job execution examples

**Key Features:**
- Job dependency chains
- Dependency checking
- Sequential job processing

**Example:**
```javascript
const job1 = await queue.add('step1', data1);
const job2 = await queue.add('step2', data2, {
  dependencies: [job1.id]
});
```

### 7. Rate Limiting

**What it is:** Control the rate at which jobs are processed to avoid overwhelming external services.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Rate-limited queue with controlled concurrency
- API call rate limiting examples

**Key Features:**
- Controlled job processing rates
- External service protection
- Rate limit configuration

**Example:**
```javascript
// Worker with limited concurrency
const worker = new Worker('rate-limited-queue', processor, {
  concurrency: 1, // Process only 1 job at a time
});
```

### 8. Concurrency Control

**What it is:** Limit the number of jobs processed simultaneously to manage resource usage.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Image processing queue with limited concurrency
- Resource-intensive task management

**Key Features:**
- Configurable concurrency levels
- Resource management
- Performance optimization

**Example:**
```javascript
// Worker that processes max 2 jobs simultaneously
const worker = new Worker('image-processing-queue', processor, {
  concurrency: 2,
});
```

### 9. Job Events

**What it is:** Real-time events emitted during job lifecycle for monitoring and debugging.

**Demonstrated in:**
- Event listeners in queue and worker setup
- Real-time monitoring system

**Key Features:**
- Job lifecycle events (waiting, active, completed, failed, stalled)
- Event-based monitoring
- Real-time status updates

**Example:**
```javascript
queue.on('completed', (job) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} completed successfully`);
});

queue.on('failed', (job, err) => {
  console.log(`Job ${job.id} failed: ${err.message}`);
});
```

### 10. Queue Monitoring

**What it is:** Comprehensive monitoring system for queue health, performance, and alerts.

**Demonstrated in:**
- `src/monitor/setup.js` - Complete monitoring system
- `src/routes/monitor-routes.js` - Monitoring API endpoints

**Key Features:**
- Real-time queue status
- Performance metrics
- Alert system
- System health monitoring

**Example:**
```javascript
// Get queue status
const [waiting, active, completed, failed] = await Promise.all([
  queue.getWaiting(),
  queue.getActive(),
  queue.getCompleted(),
  queue.getFailed(),
]);
```
